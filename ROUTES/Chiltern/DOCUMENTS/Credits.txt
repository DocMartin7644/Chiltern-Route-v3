CREDITS

A particular vote of thanks goes to: 
David Forrest for help in preparing the route for distribution, including making snow and night textures where needed and checking for errors and duplications.
Richard Stevenson for testing the route and writing numerous activities for it.
Chris Jakeman and Rick Loader for great help with GitHub.

Special thanks go to the following (in alphabetical order):

Les Burley for helping me obtain GWR track plans.
Tim Booth for his superb UK Fine Scale track system, UKFS textures for default track and Dynatrax utility.
Joseph Pearson for his BR track project.
Simon Barnes for customized GWR signal boxes, customized signals and for GCR and GCR/GWR joint route signalling diagrams.
Frank Carver for sharing his unpublished models and allowing me to adapt his textures. Also for animating my F86 Sabre and for coordinating its landing with his model of the B52.
Brian Bere-Streeter for permission to reskin his terrace houses and to use his unreleased houses under construction and his unreleased Ruston-Bucyrus models (some parts and textures of latter by Paul Charland).
EricC for building replacement embankment models which accept shadows correctly.
Dave Corfield for retrieving the 3rd/4th rail Dynatrax profiles for me, needed to model 4th rail curves on the LT lines in the route.
Henry Davidson for invaluable advice on the London Transport Underground system.
Geoff Forrest for help in tracking down signalling errors.
Reg Furniss for adapting his GWR Water Column to fit between tracks at 12ft way.
Clive Heard for permission to use custom objects from his BTB route.
Jimi Ibett for graciously sharing many of the objects from his District Line route and for his invaluable advice regarding London Underground signalling.
The late Doug Lee for his tremendous help providing information to guide my making of many of the custom road vehicles I have built for this route.
Ian Macmillan for his generous help in improving my model of the OIR dumpcar and for building the PO quarry wagons used by the Associated Portland Cement works at Blechington.
Charles Malcolm for permission to use his original models from his excellent Bedford - Hitchin route.
Tim Mitchell, author of the Woodhead route, for permission to use his track layout at Woodford Halse as a guide for my own version of the station and related yards.
Larry Mullett for his encouragement and advice for my early modelling projects.
Frank Sandwell for sharing his models and in particular for adapting his travelling crane to suit High Wycombe West Yard.
Gerald Saunders for great help with headboards, batch files and the TSRE5 editor and for creating the DynaTrax Match utility to remove unneeded dynamic track sections.
Phil Baines  and the late Gary Soden for kindly allowing me to use objects from the Westvale route.
Colin Smith for providing information on LT Underground gradients and signalling.
Murray Tremellen and the Marlow and District Railway Society for valuable help with the Maidenhead and Marlow branches.
Derek Wilde for building Marylebone Signal box for me.
Michael Willis for kindly allowing me to integrate and adapt his unfinished Oxford route.
Sjoerd Ydelma for allowing me to reskin and use his underground station models.
John Yelland for his wonderful GWR signals and for building a number of additional signals for me not included in his GWR pack.

Thanks also to the following creators of tools and utilities which make route building considerably easier than it would otherwise be:

Ted Curphey for his FF rulers.
Dado for his Rulers.
Ed Fielden for his Gradient Converter utility.
Paul Gausden for Shape Viewer.
Derek Wilde and Vince Cockeram for their Align Utility.
Gerald Sauders for his MSTS Check, sms_Checker, sigcfg_Checker, MSTS_ActMan and Activity Times Checker utilities.
Mike Simpson for RouteRiter and Carlos HR for the MSUtils utility included in it.

I found the following website invaluable for converting distances expressed in miles on my track plans to metres: http://www.worldwidemetric.com/measurements.html

My thanks too to the many contributors to the UKTrainSim forums, Elvas Tower, the GCR forum and the GWR e-list, who have encouraged, advised and provided invaluable information during the building of this route.
