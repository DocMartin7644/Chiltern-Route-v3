README FOR:  CLASS_58 CABVIEW_V2.zip  

This is my first cabview so it was all experimental, trial and error ect.
------------------------------------

I have kept the installation procedure as simple as possible, if i did it another way i think everyone would have to change the name of all there 58.eng files, which would lead to probs in activies that already use the 58. If you know of any other way of doing it, please send me a PM on the UK trainsim forum.  

-------------------------------

TO INSTALL:

1: unzip to a temp folder with "use folder names" on.

2: MAKE A FULL BACKUP OF THE LOCO YOU ARE GOING TO ADD THE CAB VIEW TO.

3: if the loco has a CABVIEW folder already then you should delete it or rename it, e.g. "CABVIEW.bak"
 
2: Go to the temp folder and copy & paste or drag & drop the folder "CABVIEW" to the folder of the loco you are going to use it with.

3: Open the .eng file of the loco that you are using and look for the "CabView" entry e.g. "CabView ( xxxxxxx.cvf )" .
This should be changed to "CabView ( class58_cab.cvf )" .

4. Open the "Cabview" folder, open up the "class58_cab.cvf" and find the  "Engine Data" entry e.g. "( 58041 )" (usually near the bottom of the first block of text) and rename it to match the name of the .eng file of the loco you are using it with.

5: You should now be able to use the cabview in MSTS, if you get any errors and you followed step 2 you can just delete the modified locos folder and reinstate the unmodified backup folder, then start again if you want to.
