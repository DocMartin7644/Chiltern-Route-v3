README FOR:  CLASS87CABV1.1 zip (27/12/2003)

Revision 1.1
Now includes a reset button (black button to left of horn)....to restore power after an emergency application.
And Credits added to Anthony Bowden/Paul Robins,for use of their original artwork.


-----------------
This version contains Front, left and right views in 1024 size textures.
And is fully animated.
It does not intend to be an exact 87 cab and uses elements from other cabs.
The use of the included "eng" files requires the instalation of Jeff Ashtons 86-87-90 sounds.

------------

I have tried to keep installation procedure as simple as possible.
Installation to 87001 is straight forwards,however some knowledge of eng and cvf files is required if you wish to use it with otherlocos.

-------------------------------

I have included eng files for 87001 and 87101 as I had to modify the straight air brakes to make the cab work.
Thyristor controlled 87101 also includes wheelslip.
Both eng files also have greatly improved lighting settings,including A1.
I have also included an Alias file,which will give you a cabview in any class87.
However this will obviously not change the lights,brakes or wheelslip of that loco.

--------------------------------
TO INSTALL:

1: unzip to a temp folder with "use folder names" on.

2: To be safe mAKE A FULL BACKUP OF 87001 .

3: Go to the temp folder and copy & paste or drag & drop the folder "CABVIEW" to the folder  87001 which you are going to use    it with.Answering yes to over writing.

4: Copy & paste or drag & drop the "87001.eng" file into folder "87001".Answering yes to over writing.

5: You should now be able to use the cabview in MSTS, if you get any errors and you followed step 2 you can just delete the    modified "87001" folder and reinstate the unmodified  backup folder, then start again if you want to.

6: If You also have "87101blue" you can now place "87101.eng" into "87101blue" folder   Answering yes to over writing,And    then alias file "class87.cvf"into "87101blue" cabview folder.Answering yes to over writing. 

7: You can place the alias file "class87.cvf" into any locos cabview folder.Then Open the xxx.eng file of the loco that you    are using and look for the "CabView" entry e.g. "CabView
  ( xxxxxxx.cvf )" .This should be changed to read "CabView ( class87.cvf )",if necessary.
  Bear in mind this will not alter the locos physics.ie lights, brakes and wheelslip will not be altered.
